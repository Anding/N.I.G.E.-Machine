Complete testing and debugging of N.I.G.E. v2.0
Run benchmarks
Upgrade FORTH system software
- review screen handling words and conceive new model
	- client application is responsible for all cursor activities
	- type and emit remain vectored and process non-printing characters
	- typeraw and emitraw are non-vectored, do not process non-printing characters and write to the screen only (but will scroll, etc.)
	- COLOR keyword sets the INK variable with a color from the palette
	- SCREENMODE replaces VGA (0, VGA, 1 SVGA)
	- COLORMODE to set 16/16 or 256/0 colormode (palette only needs to work in 256/0 colormode)
- implement FORTH words corresponsing to register addresseses  (R_TEXTZERO, etc.)
Devlopment tools
- Editor: complete implementation and testing
- Revised disassembler
Tweaks
- VSYNC word to wait until vertical blank (need a register for this)
- BRA to work with destination and PC only (no from label or rel)
- Version word reads hardware version from register and software version from address
Documentation
- Reference manual includes FORTH word definitions
- Instruction set
- Memory map
- Register usage
ATLYS board
- Implement DVI and DRAM interfaces
- Port to ATLYS
New features
- Floating point
- Local variables
- FORTH scientific library
- 100MHz clock at the expense of one cycle more memory latency?
